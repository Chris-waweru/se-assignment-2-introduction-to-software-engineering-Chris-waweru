written in brackets  at the end of some of my answers are all the references i used (where applicable) and only applies to the sentence it appears at the end of.

1.) [Define Software Engineering]: 

Software engineering is the designing, development, testing, releasing and maintenance of software.

2.) [What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)]: 

Software engineering involves a more structured and organized software development process that includes requirements engineering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. In contrast, software development may be a less structured process that involves writing code, testing, and deploying the software. (linkedin article)

3.) [Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. Agile vs. Waterfall Models:] 

(I)(a) planning phase-looking into the project and figuring out the projects purpose, deadlines, required resourses and general cost

(b) requirements- gathering all that will be needed

(c) design phase- this is where the specific details of the software are set out

(d) implementation phase- where the code for the designs created is written

(e) testing phase- the software is run through tests to ensure it works as intended and errors corrected

(f) deployment- the software is releaased to the intended users or the general public

(g) maintenance- this is where updates, patches among other support features are released into the software after deployment

(II) in the agile model,several phases of the develoopment life cycle run simultenuously in no particular order while in waterfall method,each phase has to be completed before the next phase of the cycle may begin.

(4) Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Requirements Engineering:

in the agile model, multiple development phases can run simulteniously. this model is prefered when dealing with relatively large prograns that would take ages to complete if other models were to be utilized.

in the latter model, each step has to be performed in completion before the next phase may begin. this model is preffered where the program being developped is relatively smaller and not as labour intensive

(5) What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. Software Design Principles:

(I) Requirements Engineering (RE) is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system.(plp zoom recording slides)

(II)(i) importances of requirements phase in S.development include that it 

(ii) Ensures that the software meets the needs and expectations of users and other stakeholders.

(iii) Minimizes Scope Creep

(iv) Improves Quality

(v) Reduces the likelihood of costly rework and delays by identifying and resolving issues early in the development process (importances written with research from chatgpt)

(6) Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

(I) Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing software into separate, independent modules, each responsible for a distinct feature or functionality. (ituonline.com)

(II) (i) the impact of modularity in software design on maintainability are that changes in one module typically do not affect others, making bugs easier to track down and fix without risking other parts of the system and on scalability are that modular systems can be scaled more readily by adding new modules or enhancing existing ones without impacting the rest of the system.(ituonline.com)

(7) Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 

(I) (i) unit testing is testing performed on single components of a program

(ii) integration testing is done where the developers want to find out how different components of a program interact with each other

(iii) system testing is where the entire program is tested as a unit

(iv) acceptance testing is done to ensure that the developed software meets the needs of the client or the user

(II) testing is vital to software development because it ensures that tje program meets quality and functionality standards set by the client or user and the industry before it is deployed into the internet

(8) What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

(I) also known as source control, version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code (atlassian.com)

(II) they are important since they help the development teams keep track of and manage changes in their source code over time (atlassian.com)

(III) an example of a version control system is Git which is a distributed version control system (DVCS)

Key features of git include:
Distributed Architecture: Every developer has a full copy of the repository history on their local machine.
Branching and Merging: Lightweight branches and powerful merging capabilities.
Staging Area: Stage changes before committing them.
Commit History: Detailed commit history with the ability to rewrite history using rebase.
Performance: Fast performance for most operations due to its distributed nature.
Tools and Integration: Integrates with many tools and platforms, such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and CI/CD systems. (chat gpt)

(9) Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

(I) a software ppoject manager is tasked with the responsibilityh of overseeing all aspects of tyeh software development life cycle in the management of teams to ensure that all the objectives are met on  time and within budget without compromising on quality.

(II)some responsibilities include: budgeting, planning, team management, time keeping and quality assurance

(III) some of the challanges that they may face include: scope creep, customer dissatisfaction, lack of cooperation between the teams they manage, managing tight budgets with high expectations and cutting costs in case of overbudgetting

(!0) Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

(I) it is is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. (thalesgroup.com)

(II) (i) corrective maintenance- this is done when there is an error with given software eg. where the software throws out errors

(ii) preventive maintenance- this is carried out to prevent errors or vulnerabilities in the software eg security patches to prevent hacking 

(III) maintenance is essensial since it enables the programs to run at optimal efficiency, is secure and that it keeps up with industry trends

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

(I) after gaining the experties to becoming a software engineer, one might use the skills that they aquired to exploit vulnerabilities in different programs or systems and cause mullicious damage to them or hold them for ransom.

(II) to ensure that they adhere to the ethical standards, sofware developpers can have someone hold them accountable for all that they do.
